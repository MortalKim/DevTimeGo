# WakaTimeGo
A third party WakaTime server by GO

Will be separated of front-end and back-end to make it more flexible and easy to extend.

Thanks for **[@alanhamlett](https://github.com/alanhamlett)** and **[@wakatime](https://github.com/wakatime)**, can't do it without you.

Thanks for **[@Ferdinand MÃ¼tsch](https://github.com/muety)** and **[wakapi](https://github.com/muety/wakapi)**, I learned a lot from it.

Project has used some type struct form wakapi, that inspired me a lot.
